# Fortnite-Exploits

**These are most Relevant Exploits Currently Updated to version 19.30 I will not be updating these however I have listed what each offset is.**

Of course you will have to match these to your driver functions.

I have removed all LocalPawn, CurrentWeapon Checks you have to add them yourself or game will crash.

Addresses -
> PlayerCameraManager = PlayerController + PlayerCameraManagerOffset

> CurrentWeapon = LocalPawn + CurrentWeaponOffset

> WeaponData = CurrentWeapon + WeaponDataOffset

*you can contact me through my discord for help m7alex2#1001 although you shouldnt need help this is all copy and paste.*

Happy Pasting!!!
